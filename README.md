# zsyncnet
[zsync](http://zsync.moria.org.uk/) ported to .net core.

Zsync works similar to rsync, but is meant for file distribution. Unlike rsync, it just requires a simple webserver serving static content.

Originally created for narrow academic purposes, now with the intent of being a fully functional implementation of zsync.

As of 0.1.0, it should be a fully functional library. There's currently no intention of porting the zsync application itself.

Developed at [Beowulf Strategic Operations](https://beowulfso.com) for our Mod Downloader [BSU](https://github.com/BeowulfStratOps/BSU).

The package is available at [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/zsyncnet/).
